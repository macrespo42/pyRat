## Quickstart

First you need to install needed dependencies

```

By default the Agents is configured to operate on the test project ./calculator inside the repo  
so you juste to run

## Configuration

You can simply configure the project by tweaking parameters in [config.py](./config.py)

Several parameters are available:
